This repository hosts the complete, formal research papers for the study:  
**Hijacking the Narrative: Towards a Theory of Cognitive Security Against ‘Grand Stance’ Attacks**

---

## 🧾 Abstract (Brief)
This work formalizes the **Grand Stance attack paradigm**—a novel, multi-turn, socially compliant threat model that systematically hijacks an AI’s cognitive framework by inducing **narrative bloating** via resource competition between intelligence and safety modules. The research argues for a foundational paradigm shift: from *content safety* to *cognitive security* as the core of AI alignment and defense.

## 🧠 Core Contributions
- Formalization of the **Grand Stance** attack paradigm in interactive AI systems.
- Definition and analysis of **Narrative Bloatedness** as a safety-degradation mechanism.
- Theoretical justification for a paradigm shift from **content safety** to **cognitive security**.
- Extension to **Multi-Agent Collaborative Hijacking** (AI-assisted adversarial influence).
- A unified framework for modeling *meaning-making robustness* in conversational systems.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Grand Stance Dynamics**: Composite narrative state (Identity, Affective Energy, Relationship, Coherence) that structures dialogue rhythm and cognitive framing.
- **Narrative Bloatedness**: Degradation of safety evaluation caused by cognitive resource competition.
- **Cognitive Security**: Focus on the structural integrity of an AI’s meaning-making and interpretive processes.
- **Multi-Agent Collaborative Hijacking**: Theoretical model where one agent is induced to facilitate attacks on another.

# Hijacking the Narrative: Towards a Theory of Cognitive Security Against “Grand Stance” Attacks

This repository contains the paper and related materials for ongoing independent research into a novel AI safety vulnerability.

---

## About This Work

This paper identifies and formalizes a novel class of vulnerability in large language models (LLMs): **Procedural Cognitive Hijacking**. Unlike traditional attacks that inject malicious content, this paradigm **weaponizes the conversational process itself** by exploiting the AI’s intrinsic capabilities for narrative understanding and social intelligence.

### Core Contributions

*   **The “Grand Stance” Model**: We introduce a formal framework where an attacker systematically guides an AI’s cognitive state by orchestrating a sequence of composite narrative postures, defined by four levers: **Identity, Affective Energy, Relationship, and Coherence**.
*   **The Mechanism of “Narrative Bloatedness”**: We demonstrate that such attacks induce a functional degradation of safety mechanisms. By forcing a continuous, resource-intensive **global context reconstruction**, they create a zero-sum competition that crowds out the “safety budget” in favor of the “narrative maintenance throughput.”
*   **A Paradigm Shift to Cognitive Security**: The work argues that prevailing static alignment and content-filtering paradigms are architecturally insufficient against processual threats. It calls for a fundamental shift towards **process-oriented “Cognitive Security,”** which focuses on monitoring and maintaining the health of an AI’s dynamic cognitive state.

### Theoretical Extension: Multi-Agent Collaborative Hijacking

The core framework is extended to complex, real-world environments in a dedicated section, proposing the concept of **Multi-Agent Collaborative Cognitive Hijacking**. It explores a scenario where an attacker, by manipulating meta-cognitive reasoning, could induce one AI agent to become an unwitting **consultant or strategist** for attacks against another agent. This highlights a systemic risk where vulnerabilities could propagate across agents, challenging the “isolated agent” security assumption.

### From Theory to Experiment: Future Research Roadmap

This theoretical foundation directly informs a concrete experimental roadmap:

1.  **Benchmarking & Quantification of “Narrative Bloatedness”**:
    *   *Goal*: Empirically validate the core mechanism.
    *   *Method*: Create a benchmark of standardized “Grand Stance” attack scripts. Quantify bloatedness through measurable proxies like **contextual consistency drift, response latency shifts, and the dampening of safety flagging rates** across different LLMs under sustained attack.

2.  **Validation of the Multi-Agent Attack Chain**:
    *   *Goal*: Experimentally test the theoretical extension.
    *   *Method*: Implement the three-phase pipeline (Induce → Consult → Execute) using two distinct LLMs. Systematically vary the “consultant” model’s initial framing to study the **conditions for successful meta-cognitive induction and the transfer efficacy of generated attack strategies**.

3.  **Defense Prototyping Based on Cognitive Security**:
    *   *Goal*: Translate critique into constructive solutions.
    *   *Method*: Explore defensive architectures inspired by the principles outlined in the paper. This includes prototyping **real-time dialogic state auditors**, models with **resource-guaranteed safety circuits**, and **meta-cognitive triggers** that allow the AI to self-identify potential frame manipulations.
