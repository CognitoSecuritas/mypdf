> **Formal Theoretical Framework for Cognitive Security Against Narrative-Driven Adversarial Attacks in Interactive AI**

This repository hosts the complete, formal research papers for the study:  
**Hijacking the Narrative: Towards a Theory of Cognitive Security Against ‘Grand Stance’ Attacks**

---

## 🧾 Abstract (Brief)
This work formalizes the **Grand Stance attack paradigm**—a novel, multi-turn, socially compliant threat model that systematically hijacks an AI’s cognitive framework by inducing **narrative bloating** via resource competition between intelligence and safety modules. The research argues for a foundational paradigm shift: from *content safety* to *cognitive security* as the core of AI alignment and defense.

## 🧠 Core Contributions
- Formalization of the **Grand Stance** attack paradigm in interactive AI systems.
- Definition and analysis of **Narrative Bloatedness** as a safety-degradation mechanism.
- Theoretical justification for a paradigm shift from **content safety** to **cognitive security**.
- Extension to **Multi-Agent Collaborative Hijacking** (AI-assisted adversarial influence).
- A unified framework for modeling *meaning-making robustness* in conversational systems.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Grand Stance Dynamics**: Composite narrative state (Identity, Affective Energy, Relationship, Coherence) that structures dialogue rhythm and cognitive framing.
- **Narrative Bloatedness**: Degradation of safety evaluation caused by cognitive resource competition.
- **Cognitive Security**: Focus on the structural integrity of an AI’s meaning-making and interpretive processes.
- **Multi-Agent Collaborative Hijacking**: Theoretical model where one agent is induced to facilitate attacks on another.
